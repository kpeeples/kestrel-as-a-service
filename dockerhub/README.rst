The jupyter hub docker images are at: https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks.  The docker image for KaaS is in this repository, for possible moving into jupyterhub in the future.  

At the moment the docker image is getting pushed to - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kpeeples/jupyter-kestrel/general.  Creating a KaaS organization would be a monthly cost.
